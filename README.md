## Overview

Website for VAS based gaming platform

## Installation

### Prerequisites
To get started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:

- Node.js 18.x or later (recommended to use Node.js 20.x or later)

> Windows Users: place the repository near the root of your drive if you face issues while cloning.

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
    > On `npm` some included packages can cause peer-deps issue with React 18 while installing.
    >
    > Use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag, at the end of the installation command, as a workaround for that.

2. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
